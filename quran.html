        <h2>Surah Al-Fatiha</h2>
        <p>In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
        <p>All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds.</p>
        <p>The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
        <p>Master of the Day of Judgment.</p>
        <p>You alone we worship, and You alone we ask for help.</p>
        <p>Guide us on the Straight Path.</p>
        <p>The path of those who have received Your grace; not the path of those who have brought down wrath upon themselves, nor of those who have gone astray.</p>
